====================
Get your credentials
====================

To communicate with the Customer Management Service by using the REST API, you
need your Rackspace account username, API key, and account number.

.. note::
     In the API service documentation, the account number is referred to as
     **ran** or **RAN**.

To get this information:

1. For Rackspace cloud, log in to the
:mycloud:`Rackspace Cloud Control Panel<>`.
2. For Dedicated hosting , log in to :myrack:`MyRackspace Portal<>`.

-  Your account username is the username that you use to log in.

-  To get your API key, follow the instructions in
   :how-to:`View and reset your API key <view-and-reset-your-api-key>`.

.. important::
      Protect your API key. Do not expose the value in code samples, screen
      captures, or insecure client-server communications. Also, ensure that
      the value is not included in source code that is stored in public
      repositories.
