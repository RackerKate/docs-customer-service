General API information
=======================

The information in this section is relevant to all operations of the API.
For details about specific operations, see the
:ref:`API reference <api-reference>`.

The |api-service| is implemented by using a RESTful web service interface. Like
other Rackspace Cloud services, this service shares a common token-based
authentication system that allows seamless access between products and
services.


.. note::

    All requests to authenticate and operate the service are performed using
    HTTPS on TCP port 443. For authentication instructions, see
    :ref:`Authentication <authentication>`.
